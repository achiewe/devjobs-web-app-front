### What I learned

in building this DevJobs web app, i have expanded my skill set significantly. i delved into frontend development using React and Redux, mastered backend development with Node.js and Express.js, and became proficient in MongoDB and Postman for database and API handling. The highlight was creating a versatile filtering system for job listings by title, location, and job type. This project challenged me to overcome obstacles and emphasized the importance of clear documentation. it's been an invaluable learning experience, and i'm excited to apply these skills to future projects and continue my growth as a developer.
